            Surrounded by Five Mountains
          </p>
          <p class="content-text">
            Indonesia has many mountains because it is located between two faults in the earth's plate. There is
            something unique
            about Magelang, which is the only city in the world that is surrounded by five mountains at once, namely
            Mount Merbabu,
            Merapi, Sumbing, Telomoyo, and Menoreh.
            <br><br>
            This is an interesting phenomenon in the world and even in Indonesia. Not surprisingly, if Magelang is an
            area that has
            a cool atmosphere, this is also the inspiration for the Magelang Military Academy to name it Panca Arga,
            where Panca
            means five and Arga means mountain, for one of its residential areas.

            The mountain which in legend is known as the "Pakunya Tanah Jawa" is located in the middle of Magelang City

            the first tomb
            is the tomb of Shaykh Subakir who is said to be the conqueror of Mount Tidar, the tomb of Kyai Panjang, and
            the tomb of
            Kyai Semar who is said to be an important puppet figure.

            Borobudur Temple was built in 824 AD by King Samaratungga during the Syailendra dynasty. The construction of
            Borobudur
            Temple was completed in 847 AD by Ratu Prabudawardhani, daughter of Samaratungga to glorify Mahayana
            Buddhism.
            <br><br>
            Borobudur Temple is located in Borobudur Village, Borobudura District, Magelang Regency, Central Java with

            City of a Million Flowers
          </p>
          <p class="content-text">
            The city of Magelang in the Dutch colonial era was also known as Tuin Van Java, or which means the garden or
            garden of
            the land of Java.
            <br><br>
            In addition, many Dutch people used to love to plant flowers, apart from being a symbol of prestige, it was
            also a way
            of life. Flower plants also made the Dutch feel at home in Magelang. At that time, flowers that were popular
            among the
            Dutch in Magelang were lilies and gladiolus.
